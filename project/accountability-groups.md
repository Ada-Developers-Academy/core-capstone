# Tech Stack Groups

You will be assigned to a small group with a similar tech stack. Each group will also be assigned a Project Manager. These groups are meant to create mutual accountability, and give and recieve technology assistance along with general support.

## Standups

## Weekly Demos

- These demos will be set up by your PM.
- The purpose of the demo is to show off what you have worked on during the week. This can include:
  - Features: in design, in code or completed
  - Roadblocks and struggles faced during the week
  - Code celebration: Any code that you were excited to tackle or new concepts learned
  - Design or documentation: These two things are expected to evolve over time and may also be noteworthy to  present (especially in the first week)
- Groups are responsible for sending their PM notes from the demo including the information presented and discussed. Also, feel free to follow-up with your PM if there are any action items that come out of the demos.
- *Note*: The goal is not to spend many hours preparing for presenting something for the demo, rather thinking about what you've worked on since the previous demo and sharing what feels most notable to you.

## Accountability

We as instructors will sort you, but the degree to which you hold one another accountable is up to the members of each group. While we could impose a set of standard accountability methods on each group, teams in industry -particularly the experimental teams and start ups that capstone projects tend to simulate- are sometimes called upon to create their own structures of accountability. If you are a student who knows they will benefit from additional scaffolding, **it is in your best interest to spearhead conversations about accountability**. Here are some strategies you may consider:

- Regular standups
- Weekly group retros
- Tech-stack Slack channel
- Trello checks with other team members
