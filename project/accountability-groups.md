# Accountability Groups

You will be assigned groups that will assist in creating mutual accountability, getting technology assistance and general support.

## Weekly Demos

You will be required to present your weekly progress to your capstone group.

- Groups will set their own schedule, but inform their PM of the weekly time. The recommended duration is no more than one hour, so plan accordingly.
- The purpose of the demo is to show off what you have worked on during the week. This can include:
  - Features: in design, in code or completed
  - Roadblocks and struggles faced during the week
  - Code celebration: Any code that you were excited to tackle or new concepts learned
  - Design or documentation: These two things are expected to evolve over time and may also be noteworthy to  present (especially in the first week)
- Groups are responsible for sending their PM notes from the demo including the information presented and discussed. Also, feel free to follow-up with your PM if there are any action items that come out of the demos.
- *Note*: The goal is not to spend many hours preparing for presenting something for the demo, rather thinking about what you've worked on since the previous demo and sharing what feels most notable to you.

## Accountability

We as instructors will sort you, but the degree to which you hold one another accountable is up to the members of each group. While we could impose a set of standard accountability methods on each group, teams in industry -particularly the experimental teams and start ups that capstone projects tend to simulate- are sometimes called upon to create their own structures of accountability. If you are a student who knows they will benefit from additional scaffolding, **it is in your best interest to spearhead conversations about accountability**. Here are some strategies you may consider:

- Regular standups
- Weekly group retros
- Tech-stack Slack channel
- Trello checks with other team members

## Other Notes

- These groups should provide a direct support and collaboration network for you during your capstone. With that being said, keep in mind that everyone has different preferences for collaboration. Which you may be taking a break, someone else may be deep in a technical problem or issue.
