# Capstone Reflections

With any large project that you've undertaken, especially one which requires a lot of personal growth and self-improvement, it's important to take time to reflect on the your process for completing the project and the outcomes of the decisions you made along the way.

We're providing a set of suggested reflection prompts / questions that you can use to consider how things went with your capstone project, and we encourage you to add your own prompts as well!

## Reflection prompts

1. What did you learn about:
    * Researching new technologies and investigating their applicability to a specific project?
    * Building a software system comprised of multiple interacting pieces?
    * Prioritization when building a proof of concept or MVP?
    * Debugging unfamiliar technologies and complex interactions between components?

1. What aspects of the project were more difficult than anticipated?
1. What aspects were less difficult than anticipated?
1. What features in your project were not possible in the time frame provided? Why?

1. How did your original plan of action line up with the reality?
1. Is there anything you would do differently for the next large project you undertake?
1. What are some techniques that you used successfully during this project that you would apply again in future projects?
