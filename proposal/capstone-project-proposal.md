# Capstone Project Proposal

Once you are ready: 

- Submit a Capstone Project Proposal using this [airtable form](https://airtable.com/shr3xEMBZsH0kJD8q).Group projects only need to submit one proposa. 
- Schedule a meeting with your 1:1 instructor between **July 12 - July 21st** for feedback. Proposals need to be submitted at least 24 hours prior to your scheduled meeting. This gives the instructor time to provide feedback. 

Approvals must be approved by 1:1 instructor in order to move onto the the next phase of capstone.
