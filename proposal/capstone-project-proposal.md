# Capstone Project Proposal

Once you are ready: 

- Submit a Capstone Project Proposal using this [airtable form](https://airtable.com/shr3xEMBZsH0kJD8q) between **July 12th - July 21st**. Group projects only need to submit one proposal. 
- Schedule a meeting with your 1:1 instructor to review your proposal by **Thursday, July 22nd**. Proposals need to be submitted at least **24 hours** prior to your scheduled meeting. This gives the instructor time to provide feedback. 

Approvals must be approved by 1:1 instructor in order to move onto the tutorial phase of capstone.
