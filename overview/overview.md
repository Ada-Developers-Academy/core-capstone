# Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom. Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors, mentors, and TAs) what gets built when (and how). Your capstone should be something you will be proud to show off and something you will get to learn a lot from! 

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- Learn and implement new technologies
- Complete a product lifecycle from conception to delivery
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion

## Capstone Requirements

The requirements for capstone are intentionally open-ended and vague. First and foremost, this project is for you! For the sake of formalizing the ambiguity and allowing you to feel successful and on track, here is a short list of requirements.

- Students should create a project proposal that includes:
  - At least one input (i.e. specific user interactions, data)
  - Identifying an ideal user
  - At least one, ideally two, outputs (i.e. report, recommendation)
- Students demonstrate learning a new technology.
- There is a code base for all relevant parts of the project on GitHub that the assigned PM has access to.
- Weekly 1:1 with PM to ensure consistent communication
- If relevant, deployment is encouraged. This will be decided between you and your 1:1 instructor during the project proposal process.
- Student presents their capstone project to C18 and the Ada community.
