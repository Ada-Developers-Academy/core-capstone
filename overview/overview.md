# Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom, it is two weeks long, and you will be your product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors and TAs) what gets built, when, and how. Your capstone should be something you will be proud to show off and something you will get to learn a lot from!  

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- Deepen and extend knowledge learned about the tools and technologies used during class 
- Complete a product life cycle from conception to delivery, including deployment
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion


## Capstone Requirements

The requirements for capstone are intentionally open-ended and vague. First and foremost, this project is for you! For the sake of formalizing the ambiguity, and allowing yourself to feel successful and on track, here is a short list of requirements.

- Students should create a project proposal that includes:
  - At least one input (i.e. specific user interactions, data)
  - Identifying an ideal user
  - At least one, ideally two, outputs (i.e. report, recommendation)
- Students demonstrate independent research by incorporating an additional library (Python or React) or external web service. 
- There is a code base for all relevant parts of the project on GitHub that the instructor has access to.
- 1:1 check-ins with instructors to ensure consistent communication, and filling out the daily check-in form between July 19th-27th.
- Deployment is required
- Student presents their capstone project to C15 Accelerate and Ada community

## Important Dates

- Friday, July 2nd from 2:00 to 3:00pm PDT in ada.accelerate.org: 
  - Sarah, Nat, and instructors will facilitate a space for students to continue gleaning information, inspiration, and brainstorming ideas you’d like to see come to life, and skills you’d like to gain. This is also an opportunity to pitch your idea to classmates, and find a capstone partner or group, if you choose to go that route.

## 4 Steps to Capstones

### Step 1: Inspiration & Brainstorming

Simon presented content on the 23rd about how to choose a project. 
  - You can refer to that information [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MgI35e7FoChKBsXdcA703Hkm9kwqrPWyGfOedSrVXGQ/edit?usp=sharing)
 
Capstone Examples
 - You also had the opportunity to see some capstone examples presented by former Adies. 

Capstone Pitching Session
 - Friday, July 2nd from 2:00 to 3:00pm PDT
   - Sarah, Nat, and instructors will facilitate a space for students to continue gleaning information, inspiration, and brainstorming ideas you’d like to see come to life, and skills you’d like to gain. This is also an opportunity to pitch your idea to classmates, and find a capstone partner or group, if you choose to go that route.

### Step 2: Capstone Project Proposal

A capstone project proposal is where you outline the project’s MVP and tech stacks. [Here is an example of a project proposal.](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/core-capstone/blob/accelerate/proposal/sample-proposal.md) 

You will make several capstone project proposals, and meet with your 1:1 instructor to review them and have one signed off.
- You will submit your capstone project proposal to your 1:1 instructor through this [Airtable form](https://airtable.com/shr3xEMBZsH0kJD8q) by Mon, July 12, 9 AM PDT. This gives the instructor time to read over and process your proposal.
  - Submit two or three proposals so you have a few options
  - If you are working as a group, make sure all members are included in the proposal, and submit only one copy of each proposal per group.
- Your instructor will schedule a meeting with you sometime between Tue 13 July, and Thu 15 July.
- Your instructor will give you a yes or no, with feedback during your meeting. This decision is derived from reasonable evidence and confidence from the student that they will be successful in achieving their goals stated at the beginning of the proposal.

### Step 3: Work Time

You will have two weeks to complete your capstone project and presentation. 
- Fill out the [daily check-in form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvJhc_YczSw79rs1dEQQbuSg6QrFCZ2ZPv_YMObPtoeVOf6w/viewform?usp=sf_link) between July 19 and 27 by noon PST, so instructors can track and support your progress
- Code Freeze is on Wednesday, July 28th, 11:59 pm PDT. 

### Step 4: Presentation

Capstone presentations will be on Friday, July 30th starting at 4:00pm. Exact timing and schedule will be communicated closer to the time.

- Timing: ~10 minute presentation (~7 minutes to present, ~3 minutes for Q+A)

- Presentation options:
  - Pre-recorded presentation
  - Live presentation through screen sharing

- Recording: Overall capstone presentations will not be recorded.

Projects are most commonly presented in the form of a slide deck with an embedded video demo. However, feel free to present in whatever way makes most sense to you! 
Your presentation should include and answer:
- A brief introduction of who you are and what inspired you to make this app
- What problem does the app solve? What inspired you to create this app?
- Talk about how you did it
- What are 1-2 things you learned? Focus on what you learned about programming as an art/craft/profession, not what specific technologies you learned to build the app.
- Live demonstration
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?

 - Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used, and/or Future enhancements
