# Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom. Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors, mentors, and TAs) what gets built when (and how). Your capstone should be something you will be proud to show off and something you will get to learn a lot from! 

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- Learn and implement new technologies
- Complete a product lifecycle from conception to delivery
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion

## Capstone Requirements

The requirements for capstone are intentionally open-ended and vague. First and foremost, this project is for you! For the sake of formalizing the ambiguity, and allowing yourself to feel successful and on track, here is a short list of requirements.

- Students should create a project proposal that includes:
  - At least one input (i.e. specific user interactions, data)
  - Identifying an ideal user
  - At least one, ideally two, outputs (i.e. report, recommendation)
- Students demonstrate learning a new technology
- There is a code base for all relevant parts of the project on GitHub that the assigned PM has access to
- Weekly 1:1 with PM to ensure consistent communication
- If relevant, deployment is encouraged. This will be decided between you and your 1:1 instructor during the project proposal process.
- Student presents their capstone project to C15 and Ada community

## 7 Steps to Capstones

### Step 1: Inspiration & Brainstorming

### Step 2: Capstone Concepts
A capstone concept is a general idea of the project you want to build, including its objective and features. 

You will submit 1-3 capstone concepts by Friday, July 2nd through the Learn form. 
- If your 1:1 instructor has further questions about your capstone concepts, they will reach out to talk more. 
- Otherwise, they will provide feedback, and give you the thumbs up by Wednesday, July 14th. 
- You will then choose one concept and create your capstone project proposal. 

### Step 3: Capstone Project Proposal

A capstone project proposal is where you outline the projectâ€™s MVP and tech stacks. [Here is an example of a project proposal.](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/core-capstone/blob/main/proposal/sample-proposal.md) 

You will schedule a meeting with your 1:1 instructor by Thursday, July 22nd. 
- You are strongly encouraged to schedule this meeting during the week of July 12th, since the following week is Interview Week. 
- You will submit your capstone project proposal to your 1:1 instructor through this Airtable form form 24 hours prior to your scheduled meeting. This gives the instructor time to read over and process your proposal. One project proposal per group!
- Your instructor will give you a yes or no, with feedback during your meeting. This decision is derived from reasonable evidence and confidence from the student that they will be successful in achieving their goals stated at the beginning of the proposal.

### Step 4: Tutorial Phase

The tutorial phase is when you practice using the tech in a low-stakes environment prior to starting your project.

We highly recommend that you complete at least one tutorial by Monday, July 26th. 
- We are confident that by completing this tutorial, you will be more prepared for your capstone project.
- Reach out to your 1:1 instructor if you feel you need the support after a tutorial or you need to discuss the relevance of the tutorial.
- You will eventually demo your tutorial to your tech stack group.

### Step 5: Tech Stack Groups & PM

You will be assigned to a small group with a similar tech stack. 

You will receive your group assignment on Monday, July 26th. 
- Each group will also have an assigned instructor who will provide support as project manager. 
- Your PM will set group expectations, facilitate 1:1s, daily standups and weekly demos.

### Step 6: Work Time

You will have just over three weeks to complete your capstone project, including a presentation. 

Code Freeze is on Tuesday, August 17th, 11:59pm PST. 

### Step 7: Presentation

Capstone presentations will be on Thursday, 8/19 and Friday, 8/20. Exact timing and schedule will be communicated closer to the time.

- Timing: ~10 minute presentation (~7 minutes to present, ~3 minutes for Q+A)

- Presentation options:
  - Pre-recorded presentation
  - Live presentation through screen sharing

- Recording: Overall capstone presentations will not be recorded.

Projects are most commonly presented in the form of a slide deck with an embedded video demo. However, feel free to present in whatever way makes most sense to you! 
Your presentation should include and answer:
- A brief introduction of who you are
- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- Talk about how you did it
- What are 1-2 things you learned? Focus on what you learned about programming as an art/craft/profession, not what specific technologies you learned to build the app.
- Live demonstration
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used
- Optional: Future enhancements

Presentation link is due [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZluozTih8Jr-AxZdytRfyDV46o9DsLnz6mVCB5CT61c/edit?usp=sharing) by August 18th at 5pm PST.
*This is only if you are choosing the format of a fully recorded presentation. If you are doing a live presentation, please sign off on the spreadsheet.

## Things You Need to Do

### Pre-Capstone: Determine your Capstone Project Concept and Technologies

Your goal here is to determine your capstone project concept and its tech stack.

You have two tasks:

1. Pre-Capstone Ideas Research:
    - Complete a [cap ]
1. Fill out the [Capstone Concept Form](https://airtable.com/shrJhKkItdAN5DKdi) with your top idea
1. Create a Plan

### Pre-Capstone Research

Use the following resources to begin your research so you can make informed decisions about your capstone ideas:

- [Advice for Brainstorming](brainstorming.md)
- Our resources on Tech Stacks
  - [Definition](tech-stacks.md)
  - [Examples](tech-stack-examples.md)
  - [The Research Presentation](./research-activity.md)
- Talk with your classmates
- Talk with the people around you! Mentors, TAs, instructors, family members, friends, etc.
- Every other resource available to you!

When you have 1-3 ideas for capstone, you'll need to record those ideas in the [Capstone Concepts Form](../concept/capstone-concept.checkpoint.md).

Then, bring them to an advisory 1:1 meeting with an instructor. That advisory meeting will be used to talk through any questions of the idea, including questions around scale, risks, and feasability.

If you do not turn in this form and have an advisory 1:1 meeting in time, you may not be able to start the project on the first day of the capstone period.

### Capstone Proposal Form

Once you feel that your capstone concept is firm, submit your capstone concept with the [Capstone Proposal Form](TODO) by the due date.

Then, the instructional team will review it and approve for you to start your capstone project on the first day of capstone.

If you do not turn in this form by the due date, you may not be able to start the project on the first day of the capstone period.

### Week 1: Create Your Capstone Plan & Begin Tutorials

Three goals:

- Begin the tutorials of some of your technologies (~8 hours)
- Create wireframes for your product if this is applicable
- Break up your project into tasks, and organize those tasks into two waves

## During Capstone Weeks 2-4

### Weekly:

- Demo your progress to your capstone teams every Friday
  - Your PM may attend these demos
- Schedule and attend a 30 minute one-on-one with your PM
  - The 1st week's one-on-one, you can expect your PM will talk with you about the following:
    1. Look through your Trello Sprint board with you. Your PM can give guidance about any best-practices you might benefit from following and generally any changes that could be made so the board serves you better.
    1. Talk through your intended timeline and due dates you've set for yourself. Your PM can give helpful input about how realistic the timeline might or might now be.
  - The following weeks' one-on-ones, you can expect your PM will check-in with you about how you're tracking against the timeline you setup. Your PM is there to help you navigate being behind and strategize which things could be deprioritized to make your timeline more realistic. 

### Daily:

- On each weekday hold a stand-up with your accountability group
- Complete the [daily stand up form](https://forms.gle/eShZwwVQh5UoN5H78) __everyday Monday through Friday before 12pm, and once over the weekend__

## Final Delivery

The Capstone Project consists of the following components:

- Completed application, live on the web
- The source code of your project on GitHub, with:
  - Clear documentation on how to setup/install your project
  - Any third-party dependencies or configuration required
  - A link to your Trello board
  - A link to your Product Plan
- If your capstone includes a hardware component, you must complete these additional requirements and put them on your GitHub repo:
  - Parts list, with links, for the device(s)
  - A markdown document with step-by-step instructions for assembling, verifying, and integrating the device(s) with your project
- Project Presentation, a demo of the application and pertinent information about your project

### Accountability Teams

You'll be assigned to a three or four person team. For the duration of capstone, your team members will serve as your sounding board, rubber ducks, and first-responders for your project. You are expected to be responsive to requests for help from your team (within reason), and to utilize the expertise of your teammates when you need help.

### Process Guidelines

- Use your product plan to lead the functionality development of your application
- Create and maintain a Trello board to document progress on your project
- Practice TDD to lead the development process

### Technical Guidelines

- Review the information on [technology stacks](tech-stacks.md)
