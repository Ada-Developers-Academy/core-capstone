# Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom. Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors, mentors, and TAs) what gets built when (and how). Your capstone should be something you will be proud to show off and something you will get to learn a lot from! 

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- Learn and implement new technologies
- Complete a product lifecycle from conception to delivery
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion

## Capstone Requirements

The requirements for capstone are intentionally open-ended and vague. First and foremost, this project is for you! For the sake of formalizing the ambiguity, and allowing yourself to feel successful and on track, here is a short list of requirements.

- Students should create a project proposal that includes:
  - At least one input (i.e. specific user interactions, data)
  - Identifying an ideal user
  - At least one, ideally two, outputs (i.e. report, recommendation)
- Students demonstrate learning a new technology
- There is a code base for all relevant parts of the project on GitHub that the assigned PM has access to
- Weekly 1:1 with PM to ensure consistent communication
- If relevant, deployment is encouraged. This will be decided between you and your 1:1 instructor during the project proposal process.
- Student presents their capstone project to C15 and Ada community

## 7 Steps to Capstones

### Step 1: Inspiration & Brainstorming

### Step 2: Capstone Concepts
A capstone concept is a general idea of the project you want to build, including its objective and features. 

You will submit 1-3 capstone concepts by Friday, December 17th at 9am PST through the Learn form. 
- If your 1:1 instructor has further questions about your capstone concepts, they will reach out to talk more. 
- Otherwise, they will provide feedback, and give you the thumbs up by Tuesday, December 21st. 
- You will then choose one concept and create your capstone project proposal. 

While creating these capstone concepts, you will need to propose a tech stack for your project. [Consider starting your research by reading through some tech stack examples.](./tech-stack-examples.md)

### Step 3: Capstone Project Proposal

A capstone project proposal is where you outline the project’s MVP and tech stacks. [Here is an example of a project proposal.](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/core-capstone/blob/main/proposal/sample-proposal.md) 

- You will submit your capstone project proposal through this link by Thursday, December 23rd. One project proposal per group!
- You will schedule a meeting with your 1:1 instructor during the week of January 3rd. 
- During your meeting, your instructor will give you a yes or no, with feedback. When making this decision, instructors are looking for evidence and confidence from the student that they will be successful in achieving their capstone goals.

### Step 4: Tutorial Phase

The tutorial phase is when you practice using the tech in a low-stakes environment prior to starting your project.

We highly recommend that you complete at least one tutorial by Monday, January 24th. 
- We are confident that by completing this tutorial, you will be more prepared for your capstone project.
- Reach out to your 1:1 instructor if you feel you need the support after a tutorial or you need to discuss the relevance of the tutorial.
- You will eventually demo your tutorial to your tech stack group.

For an initial list of tutorials to consider, [feel free to start with our tutorial sites resource.](./tutorial-sites.md)

### Step 5: Tech Stack Groups & PM

You will be assigned to a small group with a similar tech stack. 

You will receive your group assignment on Monday, January 24th. 
- Each group will also have an assigned instructor who will provide support as project manager (PM). 
- Your PM will set group expectations, host weekly 1:1s, and weekly demos.
- Daily standups are also an important part of the day-to-day in tech! They ensure structure, community, and consistent communication within the group.
  - Your PM will facilitate and model daily standups during Week 1 of capstones. These standups will start on Tuesday, January 25th.
  - After Week 1, students are expected to take turns hosting, facilitating, taking notes, and sending notes to your PM at the end of every standup.
  - Instructors will attend standups once/week for demos.

### Step 6: Work Time

You will have just over three weeks to complete your capstone project, including a presentation. 

Code Freeze is on Tuesday, February 15th, at 5pm PST. 

### Step 7: Presentation

Submit recorded project presentation link [here] [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L7ChcHwnQCVuwkWr8WqjUNkoSmcA5S3Fxuucw94CQwk/edit] on Wednesday, February 16th, at 5pm PST.
*This is only if you are choosing the format of a fully recorded presentation. If you are doing a live presentation, please indicate so on the spreadsheet.


Capstone presentations will be on Thursday, 2/17 and Friday, 2/18. Exact timing and schedule will be communicated closer to the time.

- Audience: Ada staff, your friends, family, and whoever else you’d like to invite! You will receive a digital invite with presentation links closer to the date. 

- Timing: ~10 minute presentation (~7 minutes to present, ~3 minutes for Q+A)
- Presentation options:
  - Pre-recorded presentation
  - Live presentation through screen sharing
- Recording: Overall capstone presentations will not be recorded.


Projects are most commonly presented in the form of a slide deck with an embedded video demo. However, feel free to present in whatever way makes most sense to you! 
Your presentation should include and answer:
- A brief introduction of who you are
- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- Talk about how you did it
- What are 1-2 things you learned? Focus on what you learned about programming as an art/craft/profession, not what specific technologies you learned to build the app.
- Live demonstration
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used
- Optional: Future enhancements
