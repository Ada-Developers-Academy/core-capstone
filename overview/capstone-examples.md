# Example Capstones

Below are a collection of Capstone examples derived from past student projects.  These are divided into web applications, mobile apps, and miscellaneous projects.

## Web Applications

- Buy Nothing App
  - We buy and throw away TOO MUCH STUFF. How can we recycle/upcycle and share our goods with people more easily.  A website for people exchange items similar to the facebook buy nothing groups.
  - Front-End:  React.js
  - Back-End:  Java/Spring Boot API
  - Deployed to:  AWS
- Adie Offers
  - A private Adie company offer resource that will help adies advocate for equal pay and make more informed decisions regarding employment.  The site will allow adies to see compensation offers for comparable positions.
  - Front-End:  React.js
  - Back-End:  Django
- Speak To Me
  - We have many powerful chat programs available from big companies like Facebook and Microsoft, none of these programs have the capabilities of offering live chat text translation. I will try to address this gap and build a small chat program that allows two people who speak different languages to chat with each other using their own languages.
  - Front-End:  React.js
  - Back-End:  Node/Express
  - Using Google's Translate API
  - Deployed to AWS

## Mobile Applications

- Taiwan Travel Guide:
  - For non-native speakers, gathering information about traveling in Taiwan is cumbersome. Having to navigate through various blogs, government websites, etc. it would be useful to have all that information in one place, with ability to save personal preferences and other information.
  - Front-End:  Android, React Native
  - Back-end:  Express/Node API
- Recipie Saver
  - When you have and loosely printed recipes tucked in folders or handwritten ones passed from generations that you would like stored in one place on your phone. By utilizing a Vision API you can take pictures of the recipes and store them and share them with ease.
  - Front-End:  Swift/IOS
  - Back-end: Google Firebase
  - Using [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
- Seattle Bus
  - Catching the bus can be difficult without knowing the exact location and scheduled arrival of the bus. It can also be challenging to coordinate rides with friends if you ever plan on catching the same bus as them. This app would allow users to see the timetables and public transit stops of King County public transit.
  - Front-End:  Android Studio (Java)
  - Back-End:  Google Firebase


## Miscellaneous Projects

- Seattle Bicycle Master Plan
  - A hardware application which connects a microcomputer (Rasberry Pi) to a mobile phone and lighted jacket.  The application will provide turn-by-turn bicyclist directions and illuminate the proper side of the jacket prior to turns.  In this way cars will be informed as to the direction the bicyclist will turn.
  - Front-End:  Andoid Studio & Raspberry Pi device
  - Using an existing mapping API for turn-by-turn directions
- my-irc
  - A terminal based IRC client. Users will be able to start the client, change their settings, connect to a network, and join multiple channels. They will also be able to have multiple private conversations with other users.  This solves the problem of having to use a complicated or system intensive client just to use a very simple protocol.
  - Front-End & Back-End:  Python with an IRC library
