# Advice from Staff

This is just some additional advice from staff to supplement but certainly not replace the [Advice from Alumni](advice-from-alumni.md) document.


## Planning Board

Tools are more useful when we understand their purpose. A planning (Trello) board is meant to help you with:

* Focus (ideally one thing in progress at a time) 
    * Also when you think of other things you need to do, you can add a card to the backlog real quick and come back to your current task.
* A sense of completion (your cards should be small enough that you’re able to complete at least one almost every day.  If this isn't true split them into smaller pieces.)
* A visual representation of your priorities - ensuring you will get to the things that are most important and not get distracted by other things
    * Organize your Trello cards into columns for each “Sprint/Week”. (This way you have some idea how you’re tracking: whether you’re ahead, behind, or on-track)
* Coordination - understanding who is working on what (for pairs only)

## Standup

It is very common for standup meetings to talk much more time than anyone really wants them to. It may help to write down your answers to the 3 standup questions before standup time or make time for writing answers down at the beginning of standup time. (This helps to avoid rambling or forgetting something important

The three questions to answer at each standup are:
* What did you do since last standup?
* What are you going to work on next?
* What blockers (things you need help with) do you have, if any?

## Additional Tips

* If there are one or two user stories that feel the scariest or riskiest, see if you can do those first. (That will give you more time to make mistakes and it will give you more time to change your idea if something seems like it isn’t quite going to work like you expected.)
* Deploy Early and Deploy Often. (This way you aren’t scrambling at the end to make deployment happen.)
* Timebox tasks and seek out help when you’ve exceeded the timebox. Don't let yourself work for hours in isolation without making progress. It can be so easy to do that if you don't set yourself a timer to check-in with yourself.
* If you're creating a mobile app, you don't need to deploy your front-end. Loading the app onto a mobile device directly from your computer is sufficient.
